# JOST Launcher for kickstart 1.3
Game/Demo launcher for JOST exe to run .slave for WHDLOAD compatible with 1.3 kickstart

This is kind of a clone of [TinyLauncher](https://aminet.net/package/util/misc/TinyLauncher) from "Master" Gibs (french will understand this stupid joke).

The target setup for this launcher is a CDTV with 8Mo fast memory and BlueCDTV/BlueSCSI SD Card hard disk.

You can fully control the launcher with your CDTV Remote, mouse mode or joy mode.
